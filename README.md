# Hello_World

Hi my name is Julia and I am a student at the University of Iowa! I am majoring in Marketing and Business Analytics.

I am a quick learner who values flexibility in problem solving. As a Rhetoric minor with skills in presentation and content creation, my interests in visual and written communications complement my focus on data and strategy. With internship experiences in consumer research, new product development, and analytics, I bring curiosity to every project, energizing the process. My growth mindset has led to leadership roles in the Multicultural Business Student Association and the Tippie Business Honor Society, which have developed my skills as an empathetic teammate who attunes to and facilitates group interactions.

What are some fun facts about me? I like dogs, long walks, and Italian wedding soup.
